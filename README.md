# Expedition Planner/ Bushwacker 

This project is a mapping app meant to take some of the logsitical burden out of planning multi-sport expeditions with several people. 

## Usage

The proejct can be used at: [This Link](https://bushwhacker.herokuapp.com/). Simply make an account and start planning your trip.

## Tehcnologies

This app was built in React, utlizing the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map library and integrating the two with the [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) and [react-leaflet-draw](https://github.com/alex3165/react-leaflet-draw) librarires. The app interfaces esculsivley with the [custom API](https://github.com/wlytle/expedition-planner-backend) built for the project in Rails.

## Roadmap
Future development on this project would like to focus on integrating the [USGS National Map](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/national-map) and the [Recration.gov API](https://www.recreation.gov/use-our-data) to not only show useers what land jurisdictions thier trip crosses, but also offer redirects to apply for the appropriate permits.
